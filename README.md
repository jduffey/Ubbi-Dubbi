# Ubbi-Dubbi

This repository is for a Python program that takes in text and outputs the text but in the form 
of the made-up gibberish language "Ubbi Dubbi" from the PBS show ZOOM.

This language merely involves placing an "ub" syllable before every vowel sound.

For example, the line "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" would come out as:

  "Thube quubick brubown fubox jubumped ubovuber thube lubazuby dubog"
  
  The "ub" syllable does not alter the pronunciation of the word otherwise.
